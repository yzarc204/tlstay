# THANG LONG STAY Short and Long-term Room Rental Website

## Idea
- THANG LONG STAY website is a service for renting rooms on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. Customers can easily search, refer to reviews, rent, and pay accommodation fees directly on the website. The website targets students looking for rental housing. The interface is user-friendly and suitable for Gen Z.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Laravel
- Frontend: Inertia + Vue 3 + Tailwind + Pinia
- Database: MySQL
- Payment gate: VNPAY sandbox (for testing)

## Dormitory and Room Management Module
- Managers can add/edit their list of dormitories and rooms on the website.
- Each dormitory includes the following information: dormitory name, address, coordinates, images, dormitory description, amenities provided (water heater, air conditioner, kitchen...), distance to the center (Thang Long University).
- Each dormitory has multiple floors, each floor has many rooms with customizable layouts. Each room has different rental prices. The base price is the daily rental price; when customers rent by week/month, a discount of 5 - 10% is applied.
- For monthly rentals, the rent does not include electricity and water services. Managers will add these service prices for their rooms.
- Managers have the right to edit the current tenant and the rental start/end dates of the room.

## Contract Management Module
- Allows managers to upload rental contract templates in .blade.php file format.

## Promotion Management Module
- Managers can add simple vouchers: applicable for a minimum order amount, percentage discount, maximum discount percentage, number of times each account can use, and voucher validity period.
- Statistics on usage counts of each voucher.

## Banner, Slider, Popup Promotion Management Module
- Managers have the right to manage banners, sliders, and promotional popups on the website.

- Users must provide additional information to use the room rental feature: permanent address, ID card number, date of birth, gender.
- The website has separate login pages for managers and users.

## Dormitory/Room Search Module
- Customers can search and filter dormitories by price, distance, amenities, and reviews.
- Customers can sort dormitories based on rental frequency, price, and rating.

## Room Rental Module
- Customers can rent rooms through the following flow: select dormitory -> select room -> select rental period -> add list of renters (if there are 2 or more people).
- For example, if a customer rents a room for 50 days, the rental price will be calculated as: 1 month rent + 2 weeks rent + 6 days rent.
